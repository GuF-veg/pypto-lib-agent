"""The layered query engine (DESIGN.md 6, T4).

Importing this package registers every query with the registry. The public
surface is ``execute`` / ``list_queries`` / ``get_query``: run a named
query, get back a budget-limited facts stream. Handlers read only schema
tables and the derived layer's tested pure functions — never the ingest
parsers or the raw JSON artifacts — so no raw swimlane JSON can leak into
an answer.
