"""Cycle -> us conversion mirroring swimlane_converter semantics.

The AICore<->AICPU cross-domain *join* always goes through
``simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter.read_perf_data``. This module
replicates only the cycle origin (``base_time_cycles``), the host-mode
time-base splice, and the us conversion documented in that tool, so raw
AICore rows and phase records can be stored in the same time base as the
joined task rows. Parity tests pin these formulas against the converter
at zero tolerance.

Two record schemas are accepted (simpler unified the scheduler streams in
its 2026-09 "scheduler schema" change):

- current: ``scheduler_tasks{schema_version, producer, records}`` and
  ``scheduler_records{schema_version, streams[]}`` (metrics separated);
- archived: top-level ``aicpu_tasks`` and ``aicpu_scheduler_phases``.

Host-orchestrated captures (``metadata.orchestrator_source == "host"``)
carry ``host_orchestrator_phases`` stamped in host CLOCK_MONOTONIC ns.
The converter splices the two clock domains causally: every device-domain
us value gains ``host_composite_end_us``, and host phases are expressed
relative to the host origin. Both rules are mirrored here.
