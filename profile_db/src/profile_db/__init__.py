"""pfdb: the agent-oriented profiling & feedback database for PyPTO.

Query-first, data-disposable (DESIGN.md): the database is a working set
built from ``build_output`` artifacts and can be pruned or rebuilt at
any time.

Layered imports are enforced by ``.importlinter`` at the repo root and
by the AST layering test in ``tests/``; keep the dependency direction:
``cli/mcp -> db -> schema`` and ``facts -> errors``.
