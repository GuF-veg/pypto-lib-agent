"""Schema migration runner.

Migrations are ``NNNN_name.sql`` files under ``schema/migrations/``. The
runner keeps the applied-version bookkeeping in the ``schema_version``
table itself: each pending migration runs inside its own transaction and
is recorded only after it succeeds, so a failed migration leaves the
database at the previous version (rolled back, retryable).
