"""Early-dispatch proof (DESIGN.md 6.3, T3), ported from the runtime's
structural rule and timestamp proof:

- every direct predecessor must either be an allocation source (an edge
  from a host-side creator that has no timed producer task) or a producer
  carrying ``early_dispatch`` (``allow_early_resolve``), and at least one
  must be a non-alloc early producer — otherwise the structure cannot
  claim speculative dispatch at all (``none``);
- timestamps: fold every timed producer's latest FIN into
  ``observed_ready``; a physical row (block) proves early dispatch when
  ``row.dispatch + 2 clock ticks < observed_ready``;
- status: ``full`` (every row proves), ``partial`` (some rows prove),
  ``none`` (eligible but no row proves), ``unavailable`` (no FIN stream,
  no timed producer, missing dispatch timestamps, or unknown clock).

The 2-tick tolerance matches the runtime's ``critical_path --tol``
default; the comparison is strict, so a dispatch exactly at
``ready - 2 ticks`` does not prove.
