"""Fact DSL v2: machine-oriented, line-based evidence records.

Design contract (DESIGN.md 5.4):

- One record per line: ``REC k=v ... evidence=<state>``, keys sorted,
  values JSON-encoded, deterministic byte output.
- Every fact carries exactly one evidence state
  (``measured / proven / unproven / unavailable``). The enum rejects
  anything else at construction time.
- Serialization is budget-bound: when ``max_bytes`` is exhausted the
  stream ends with an explicit ``TRUNCATED first_dropped_index=...
  remaining=... limit=...`` line. The cut is a prefix, so what survives is
  always a contiguous head of the sequence; omitted facts are never
  silently dropped.

    budget smaller than the marker itself, where the marker is still
    emitted because silent omission is never an option.
