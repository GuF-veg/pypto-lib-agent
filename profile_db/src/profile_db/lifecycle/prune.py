"""Prune (DESIGN.md 8.1): delete every run outside the working set.

The row deletion runs inside one transaction under the writer lock, so a
failed prune leaves the database untouched. Copy-mode archive files and
render-cache directories for pruned runs are removed after the commit;
link mode copies nothing, so it deletes no files. ``trial`` and
``baseline`` rows are short-term memory and survive pruning.
