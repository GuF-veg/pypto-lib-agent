"""Short-term trial memory (DESIGN.md 8.2).

A trial is one tuning experiment: ``register_trial`` opens it (running,
pending verdict), ingest binds a run to it via ``bind_trial``, and
``set_verdict`` closes it. ``parent_trial_id`` links experiments into a
lineage tree. Trial rows are memory and survive pruning.
