"""The lifecycle & short-term-memory layer (DESIGN.md 8, T8).

Working-set determination and prune read/write only schema tables plus
the filesystem (copy-store / render-cache removal); trial/baseline/compare
are the short-term memory that survives pruning. This package never
touches the ingest parsers or the raw JSON artifacts.
